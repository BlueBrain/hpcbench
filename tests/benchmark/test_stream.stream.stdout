Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 35411 microseconds.
   (= 35411 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.

WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
precision of your system timer.
